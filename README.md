# Kingpin Roulette

Kingpin Roulette is a 6-12 player game based on Mafia De Cuba, designed by Philippe des Pallières and Loïc Lamy.

You can play the bot using @KingpinRouletteBot, and i've open-sourced this bot to show the weird ways I design bots in Swift, and how I use the Pelican and TrashBoat frameworks to make the Telegram and game architecture happen.  Feel free to also laugh at how freaking weird it is though.

ALSO feel free to submit any enhancements or bugs and i'll make sure those fixes get pushed to the bot.
